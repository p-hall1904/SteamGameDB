# SteamGameDB

In this project, I have created a database to show what games me and my friends have in common. For this project I used python in order to interact with the Steam API and pull our libraries, and I used LibreOffice to create the database and edit all my data. LibreOffice is a free alternative to Microsoft Office and while it doesn't come with all the features that Microsoft does, it was a good alternative for this project.
